# Dracula, Unofficially ðŸ¦‡

The unofficial Dracula theme for Obsidian. Mostly made this for myself, but figured others might like it too. There's already [an official Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/obsidian) that you can use if that's your jam! I kinda wanted to make different color choices, which is why this theme exists.
